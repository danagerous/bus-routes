Kootenay Lake School District Bus Routes and Schedules

This was my very first experience with web mapping back in 2011. I want to update this application.

Some simple goals:

- Make respsonsive UI
- Move individual KML's to Google Fusion Tables as it is easier to manage. Re-use custom HTML for tables.
- Add ability to toggle school boundary and school locations (data resides in Fusion Tables already).
- Keep routes as a dropdown
